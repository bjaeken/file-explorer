# File Explorer

File explorer is a simple Python application to navigate through your files. 
This application is purely made to learn and test my current skillset of Python.

## Branches

For this small project there will be 2 kind of branches:
`Main:` The branch that contains all the functional code. This means that the branch will always
be **stable**.
`Develop:` In this branch will firstly all come the newly written code. Within the develop branch
the code can be tested, so after that it can be merged to **main**. 

## Feedback

Feedback will be received with open arms. Please submit an issue with the context on what
could have been done better.
